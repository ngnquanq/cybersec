# Context and Definition
It covers the fundamental of protecting information and handling potential dangers. Goals is to keep data safe in 3 main ways 
- Confidentiality: Keep information private so only authorized people see it (like encrypting data or using password) 
- Integrity: Ensure data can not be altered improperly so it can stays accurate and trustworthy (like using checksums or logs to detect tampering)
- Availabilityy: Make sure information and systems stay up and running when needed (for instance, through backups and redundancies)

Proper security and risk management is essentially to provide the CIA. In practice, this could be many steps, from defining clear policies, procedures and controls (passwords, network firewalls, ACL, training rules etc) that enfore those CIA goals. 

A major part  of this domain is risk management, which is a process to identify what could go wrong and decide how to handle it. In a simple way, it is finding and fixing problems before they happen. The basic steps of risk management including: 
- Asset identification: list out what need to protect (assets) such as customer data, financial records, hardware,etc
- Threat identification: list out possible dangers to those assets such as hackers, malware, natural disaster,etc
- Vulnerability identification: find weakness that could let threats succeed (vulnerabilities), like outdated software or open network ports. 
- Risk analysis: for each asset, combine threats and vulnerabilities to gauge risk. This usually involves estimating how likely something is to happen and how bad it would be (impact)
- Risk evaluation: Rank risks by severity so the most serious ones get attention first.
- Risk treatment: Decide how to handle each risk – you might mitigate it (add a firewall, update software), transfer it (buy insurance), avoid it (stop the risky activity), or accept it (if it’s minor)

Security and risk management also covers governance and compliance. That means setting up clear rules and policies, training staff, ensuring the org follow laws and standards. It includes planning for the worst (incident response and business continuity) so that if a breach or disaster occur, the org can recover. 

In short, this whole things is to understand what matters, what could go wrongs, how to manage it so that an organization stays safe and aligned with its goal.
