# Context and Definition

This cover the everyday activities that keep an organization's system running safely. Like in some security rooms there are hundred screens for all kinds of information like network traffic, log alerts, resource usage, etc... and people use it to respond to alarms and fix problems. 

It's operation perspective because it is how to run the day-to-day security tasks that keep organizations safe, from monitoring logs to handling incidents. Think of secops is like having a digital security guards and emergency responders for your IT environment. 

Key parts of this include:
- Monitoring and detection: By continuously watching netowrks, servers, application for weird activity. We use tools like log analyzers or SIEM systems help correlate event. 
- Incident response: When a threat or breach is detected, we need to follow a plan to contain and fix it. This means steps like identifying the problem, stopping the damage, eradicating any malware, restoring system  etc. After all, investigators can go in analayze what happened so they can improve the defense or collect evident in case something bads happen. 
- Maintainance and protection: that is we regularly patches and updates software, run virus scans and adjust firewall rules, a more proactive work like this help reduce vulnerabilities that attackers might exploit. 
- Backup and recovery: run routine backup critical data and test recovery procedures to see if anything is good to work or gone worng. Bad case is like in case of hardware failure or a cyber-attack, having reliable backups and disaster-recovery plan can ensure that the business can continue. (can ref check with the incident of AWS)
- Physical security and policies: oversee locks, badge access or surveillance on physical facilitties and enforece security policies (like user training and acceptable use) to prevent human errors. 

In short, SecOps is about being vigilant and responsive: watching over system continually and reacting fast when something goes wrong. By doing so, security can help the org data and services available and secure at all times.
