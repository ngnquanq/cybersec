# Context and Definition
It is all about making sure the right people (identification and authentication) to use the right resources (authoriziation) and only those resources (least privilege principle). As the name is already imply, it is to answer question: Who are you and what you can do. 

In simple terms, it is having a security guard checking IDs and Keys and check if are you allow to go and use that specific resources and records everything that you are doing.  

IAM tools often add conviniences like SSO or MFA. 

For example, SSO lets user log in one and access many application without typing their passowrd again. MFA means requring two or more proffs (i.e password and a code sent to your phone), which make it harder for bad factors to fake. Using IAM corerctly can help org reduce the risk of breaches because users only get the access they need. 

In short, IAM is the framework of processes and technologies that manage digital identities and control user access so that only authorized people or devices can get to sensitive data.
